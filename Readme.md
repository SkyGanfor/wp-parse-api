Bridge between [Parse](http://parse.com) api and [WordPress](http://wordpress.org)

## Description

The goal of this plugin its to replicate all your posts to [Parse](http://parse.com) so you can easily
develop mobile apps, because I find very useful their SDK and help us to develop
apps faster without worring about the security or if someone else can read data from our blog
and use it.

## Features

* Post object saved (create/update) to [Parse](http://parse.com)
* Push notifications when new post published
* Turn on/off push notifications when new post published
* Sync old post to [Parse](http://parse.com)
* Plugin can be updated from github, thanks to [WordPress Github Plugin Updater](https://github.com/jkudish/WordPress-GitHub-Plugin-Updater)

## Installation

1. Create your account on [Parse](http://parse.com)
2. Create an app
3. Create an class in the data browser with those fields:
	* categories (Array)
	* content (String)
	* date (String)
	* guid (String)
	* photos (Array)
	* thumbnail (Object)
	* title (String)
	* videos (Array)
	* wpId (Number)
4. Upload `wp-parse-api` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
5. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
6. Go to Settings -> Parse Api
7. Fill the form with the data from your Parse.com app dashboard
8. At this point it must be ready to use it

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why Parse.com?

Because I find there a well documented SDK's for the most popular mobile platforms.

### How it works?

Configure the plugin under Settings -> Parse Api as describe in the instalation. 
Every time you publish or save a published post it will create/update their 
respective row on [Parse](http://parse.com)

Then use the SDK of your prefered platform and start coding.
